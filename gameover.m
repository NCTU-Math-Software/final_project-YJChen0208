function [x y] = gameover(w, h, gap)
% The output is the `[x y]` array that can be plot to display "GAMEOVER".
% 
% About input :
% - Input `h` is the height of a word, it must be divided by 2.
% - Input `w` is the width of a word, it must be divided by 2.
% - Input `gap` is the gap between each words, it has no restriction.
% 
% The total width of "GAMEOVER" is `(w+gap)*7+w`.
% 
% Example:
% You can get the return value by
%   [x y] = gameover(108, 200, 25);
%   [x y] = gameover(18, 60, 5);
% and draw it by
%   plot(x, y, '.r');
